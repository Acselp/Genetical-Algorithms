# Genetical-Algorithms

This app was developed for my year project in the first year of collage. It consists of 3 problems:<br>
<i>Knapsack Problem</i>, <i>Traveling Sales Problem</i> and another "mini-app" which approximates<br>
the value of pi constant.<br>
So the first two problems are solved in two ways: using Genetical Algorithms and Brute Force. Actually<br>
it was made to compare this two types of algorithms and to prove that Genetical Algorithms are a quite<br>
usefull stuff in optimization.
